Each episode, a special guest star joins the comics as they tackle a series of spontaneous improvised sketches, with only a few random ideas from the studio audience and their host. With little information and a lot of imagination, the comics depict a variety of characters and scenes, and even perform songs. At the end of each round, Aisha awards points to each of the four performers and announces a winner at the end of every episode.",
